[" any truck relief valve is also decent that is decent one word i believe but like no - but we don't have a choice it's not like it's an optional thing exists decision on the fly in the middle of word that are are single word like or choose to or choose to remove them at our whim it's like antitrust is a single word and we didn't make that choice let's do it let's do a relief it is knowable to you do i need 8 do i need a hyphen between relief in valve i you never know these day consistent guideline you should be learning about how their use their always going to be any case that can be debated but the basic it wa crazy at work i wa working with a couple year ago i wa trying to teach them the rule about hyphen surprisingly hard to do because they hate for obviously they sit still dislike the person who taught them to you we do eventually learn how to tie your shoe or whatever like you do end up being able to tie your shoe but that is the end result and ending up  being able to use hyphen my success rate is like it's slightly more than 50% - school is going to work for casey actually it's between fallen immersion and knowing you two because specifying a kind of immersion correct at least this is step one he's correct version is totally booked but he is correct about the - so where you were making progress are full immersion - school is working never in a million year would i look at that freeze and think i need a hyphen between phone immersion no way i'm not saying you're wrong for the record i'm not saying you're wrong norbit it's when there's a multi word phrase that act a an adjective that describe some other thing there's multiple word that all combined to say it's that kind of thing right what kind of preschool it is it it's a full immersion preschool but it's not a full immersion preschool full immersion is required to describe it's not a full preschool and it's not an immersion preschool and it's not a full-time immersion preschool version that multi word phrase together describes the preschool so full - immersion that's the basic before we go  into when it's an adverb even 2 - 2 advanced course the basic rule returned it to get through it right step that i'm i am stupefied and now we have a free show louder than the actual people in our grammar going to yell at me for a description of all the email go to all three of u is very easy to be successfully ignorant but it's difficult to be successful educational like i tried to explain that is wrong in the subtle way in and they're going to be right and i'm going to have to endure that nation in any of that a humongous gust of wind is totally unhyphenated the way it's not humongous - gust - of wind out what kind of headache god i hate i hate everything i hate everyone i quit you're both fired never use them so normally to someone with type something in slack which we were using on or whatever and i would say what kind of file and i would say what kind of file must be a joy to work with john right so i did this for like a year and still a year into", " it i would say what kind of answer the question but like i wa like a text file do i say that it's because you use the multi word phrase to describe the five note very difficult to i'm glad that the john we have on the show the song one is the same jon at work everyone around john is subjected to the same subject get to enjoy oh god oh god what is happening what ha happened to you besides i don't like it i like it i don't know i'm going to i think i might want to hear they're like yeah i don't like it i'm just going to reboot so entertain everyone can all this i will assume if you guy genuinely if you just want to start the show that's fine i'll just pop in a second but one way or another i'll be back in town we wouldn't even know how to start this year i should note in abingdon call this follow-up and i guess it start the show i have been adding thing to my radar that i had put in my feedback that i put a link to in the  last episode i've been adding what is it spin dump tailspin cyst diagnosis i probably got that doe not exactly sure i probably got like a gig to gig and a half worth of cyst diagnosis isn't helping the whatnauts on this feedback and of course a far a i'm concerned i'm just barfing this into a black hole i mean i would not be any wiser if it wa just going to death no on some apps from apple server somewhere but anyways i have been adding all these thing trying to i've taken video with my phone of my god awful refresh rate and of my machine gun trackpad and attached it to this to this feedback i've been having a good citizen and doing what i can to get my problem fixed and i have no idea if it's actually going to any human being but that's okay but one of the thing i'm trying starting today is something that i've been suggest actually tried myself at my old imac is not using bluetooth for my peripheral for my that my keyboard and mouse and instead plugging them in so they're the official name for this with  the apple extended keep nothing you know extended keyboard ii that bluebird like whatever they call the magic keyboard with the with the 10t and then the magic trackpad there now both plugged indiana lightning cable to my imac that seems to make thing a little better so far i've also seemingly seen that a lot of network io in particular can really choke everything which seems really not good but that's the way it is. i've got for you that you know if i'm running a time machine backup to this knowledge e while doing something else on this analogy while you know i'm trying to play a video from npr tiny desk concert i've been doing non-stop for the last few day everything just get real ugly real quick so i have disabled time machine temporarily crashplan slopeside needed i rebooted so it is running out of turn that back off all sort of thing i have to do to get my computer to actually freaking work but no no catalina's great i shouldn't complain about it i'm going to ruin your feedback vs. radar know the app is called feedback in this new purple app and then  we don't use radar web anymore right but aren't they still just referring to them a feedback sore my feedback seems weird is it appropriate to be like radar made sense a both the name of the app also a the plural of radars i don't think feedback works in that way you can't say i found some feedback like that i mean you can yeah but that's not a like the noun doe not pluralize like that it's cuz obviously the portal of feedback is feedback but that's not how this work key or so at the i just mechanically doesn't work well it's just making atp ruling that it will be for now and forever more radar ended radar and then we were using with radar web or whatever cuz we just got to use the web interface we didn't see the the native application but that wa age ago so now we have a new native app for a regular people called feedback but given that the actual issue and number are all the same a they weren't radar i'm assuming it's still different client for whatever is looking to let u know is it are they  still called radaris internally do rdar url scheme to work with people internally for apple like i should be like i said i'm i'm all in on calling radar and forever more if you don't mind on switch glass and desktop background what do you what is your vision quest taking the order your vision quest taking you these day after the podcast aidells more into the code i had for a copying the desktop window and got a bunch of suggestion for lunch i'm helping people on twitter and they gave me a lot more confidence in the ability to identify an ios is probably easier and more consistent but there are multiple different competing coordinate system which is a little bit by the particular placement of my little side car display in my vast 6k display in to meet thinking that this isn't it look to me a if it wa like an off by 10 when really wa a complete coordinate system slip and just because of the nature valley or anyway once i got that straightened out and then black slip and then once i do the y-axis what i could positively identify all the thing", " so now i'm super confident in that system and i think the window copy system is the way to go that is my primary thing is still have the fall back down there but i'll probably ship the ship the window copy code it's out there right now and i thank everyone for the album clarification something obviously this should be a saying api to get this because it's apparently something lot of developer want to do if they ever show like a little miniature picture of your screen and turn on boarding when they showed like a little picture of your computer or monitor or something for her for that matter anyway it's harder than it need to be but i'm glad i found a way to do it down and then i am happy to say that the thanks to all the people who is going to the show and bought a copy and then i'm using it thank you everybody now fully funded the $400 aluminum bracket that hold hard drive for imac pro and it is sitting on my desk right now and it's hey i didn't realize before i had an app on the app  store payment according to the official party line at apple is after the end of the month in which you had sale so let's say january end when am i going to get for all those sale at the end of the month is a little bit too pessimistic and usually end around 30 day but the point is i still haven't received a penny for any of my apps not even eventually i bought it with you something that came with that i can see if i can tolerate the noise but if i can't will say i am glad that you let yourself some money that you've been wanted but not wanted for so long so congratulation marco and have you tried enabling high quality streaming i've had this is andrew writing i've had always had and i've never heard what you're referring to so this wa with regard to apple music and hearing like crummy version of song that correct in the very beginning of that isn't and i'll get better sort of like if you can fix one little buggy to fix in one day would it be and mine wa that when i start streaming", " over cellular in the music app every track begin like a half-second of very low bit-rate audio that sound awful and it look snap to the higher bitrate like responsibly like a a buffer it for a second and then play the higher one from the start or you know load it before you play it or whatever it is and basically say there's a under i think it's under music cellular and it's high-quality and if you turn the setting on this doesn't happen anymore so it wasn't technically a bug it wa a bad default setting so i turn the setting on end in one day my butt got fixed so how are you two doing on your one day but not well not well at all all right and then at some point i don't never heard yesterday that some point last week i don't know what it wa you were talking about the static analyzer in xcode and aaron farnham right and i don't know if this is true but i've no reason to believe it isn't aaron right of static analyzer skip with file only looked at sea pacific pacific to see an objective c  plus plus which is a bummer but i can't say i am surprised i wa asked her why i never saw analyzer introduced back when you know before u with existed so that kind of make sense why doesn't work with swift it's kind of like swift se static and odds are built into the compiler in bed swift is all about being able to reason about everything is going to happen in your program and no that's that's what option are about that's what it's type system is about it's not to say that swift doesn't need a lender or a static analyzer thanks twisted south the language go a long way towards catching the kind of mistake that you could in a bit of the objective c compiler will not complain that's why you need the static analyzer or some kind of winter to yell at you for doing thing that are potentially dangerous an ejector seat button switched the compiler got your back from most thing done lads right i wa startled to hear me complain that the place independent navigation hierarchy because his own podcast player overcast at the same teacher if we launched in the  background of a cat forgets where would never get it to in a smart playlist i assume regular play with 2 similarly if i navigate up one level and then back down to the end of the playlist overcast reset the view to beginning of the last rather than what i wa previously looking at marco would you like to defend yourself and let me pay for the record i wa not the person who put this in the show note it's not my fault i'm sorry yessir so this wa you i wa complaining about in the same a i went about the music app that it basically forgets everything about your navigation stack every time the app so if you got to whatever you're now playing thing is by say going for a playlist and the itunes music doe the same thing every time you launch it's like is the perimeter of it orbit launch it doesn't remember what song you were playing certain spot in this on so anyway overcast doe not remember your scroll position in those list it doe however remember what screen you were on and in what mode so basically they ever catch  the structure did a wise and you can sit on that route screen ha a contact at the playlist provider and that could be either a playlist or a podcast in that entering and whatever however you got to what you're playing is a playlist for my door so either you went to a playlist and play the next road and it play in which case the put the playlist itself is the platform and so doe the current episode or you went to a specific podcast from the root screen which then that is deep and then and then the episode with an episode and overcast always save the current to the provider and the current episode so when you relaunch it from scratch it will do that it will resume back to where wa however this person is right it doe not record your scroll position within those list that's something that frankly i just hadn't considered that like peanut people would care about the scroll position but honestly i just never really considered it that's not a bad complaint and i might have them that i'm doing all this mainly i actually because i learned ios development  with the first sdk which didn't have state restoration it didn't have storyboards it didn't hit in court date i like a back rounding did it no of course not. the interface builder and gordita i actually didn't implement state restoration in any of my apps ever i do it manually like i don't whatever you do it i'm not going with them at all i've never used them never even looked at him i used to mail in this case i just save two bit of a die like the post provider id and the current episode id and that's it i know there are a lot of state restoration apis and they were introduced right before pack grounding became a thing or maybe it's the same time doesn't really matter when but my point is they've been around for a long time and i've looked at them in age but they are definitely a thing movie on john i'm assuming you put in the show note the following microsoft defender... atp? yeah this is a microsoft product antivirus product which is slightly confusing work on ios but anyway but it's called defender advanced threat protection microsoft a their", " product name a microsoft defender atp for mac which i think is funny is in the category of antivirus anti-malware price for the max that did not destroy it and don't do giant extension did that intercept all fi network and stuff like that have a reputation for being le terrible general i would recommend virus malware product from company that from very large company or company's that make a platform like i tend to trust more like a company's sole purpose is to be antivirus i have to think they are highly motivated to make the thread to take the threat very seriously and do everything in their power because that's another check bar on their product like our product ha this doe that and the other thing where is microsoft ha how you motivated not to make your pc bog down good they get blamed for that because they're the platform better similarly the antivirus thing 19 hour thing apple ha i still invisible the people think they're not even they are even protect stuff and all the stuff i do about a cyst behind the scene in august in catalina slightly more visible those box ask me  for permission so antivirus stuff from platform owner i tend to be more optimistic about i still don't recommend anyone get any of these thing but it ha a product that is generally well-regarded and it's available for the mannequin soon ios and it's called a teepee we respond to this week by proclip usa who make awesome phone mount for your car we first

will no longer accept http certificate older than roughly 13 month not true okay tell me what's true that i've read it very quickly about 30 second ago to technology that's right i tried tried-and-true method in school how to most efficiently do homework 30 second before it still so yeah like the web would break right so that it's slightly more nuanced certificate issued before some upcoming cutoff date are grandfathered in got a five-year certificate yesterday i got a long list already passed if  you get a cert after that point in safari will not only is considered valid for like a year after the point you got it so they're not breaking the entire web but they are taking a unilateral stand to say even though the rule about how long a he'll cert can last that i need to call dad cell service in whatever you know the rule about how long i can last don't say that they can only be a year old safari is going to use whatever market clouded ha no significant market out of mobile s o n desktop is a are pretty popular browser is not going to accept certificate if it wa issued after you know whatever it is september i don't know the date i should have to be and it's more than whatever a year old and it's a sort of apple taking it ball and going home after losing the id larger set of committee argument of degree after the state certificate authority won't issue certificate the last longer than a year and there wasn't consensus on that so apple are doing it itself some of the thing like the we have", " we we think we have thing like standard of body or official committee or whatever else but when you have a really powerful vendor they can choose when when to ignore the same a body and do thing themselves apple doe this google doe this like no one no one's hand are clean here no one obeys it is all the time and that's just the reality of how the world work so in this case apple is basically saying well we tried to make you all agree on this you didn't so we're going to do it anyway without your agreement there's lot of reason why having short lifetime ssl certificate is better than having llama time one ultimately though i'm not really sure this is worth it ha lot of argument from the security people about will you know if somebody compromise your certificate then they can use it and that's really bad that's that's true my two kind of argument for that would be number one they can now still use it for up to a year like that's that's not that much a looking at whatever time interval you pick there's going to be the risk  of somebody using a certificate in within a time window a year instead of before the longest hurt you could get wa i think two year recently admitted in the past five year but in the last couple year to buy a little longer than i think 2 year but anyway you know it's that risk is still there no matter what that duration is it's an arbitrary number and shortening it from two or three year down to one year i mean yeah that help but that's still a massive risk that you know you're going to say that that insert get stolen all the time then this is obviously a problem that can happen now within one year instead of within two or three tenant secondly this just add more more to the huge annoying barrier of entry that the increasingly strict ssl requirement have brought two people who are just trying to run small website and i know that a lot of level a a cell is great or whatever whatever is a cps on a lot of level this is great and we should be using it for a lot of a lot of thing much  of the time i'm a little more on the side of right like i think people like dave winer who are who are like we don't really actually need this for a much a it's being pushed on u there's a whole lot of weapon out there that i just like playing content site that yes there are advantage to them using http proxy is not being able to inject javascript like we're on a plane or we have whatever crazy isps who inject javascript into i'm so pages like their stuff like that and there's thing like you know the way browser treat http traffic a little bit differently with thing like you know when refers or said or when cooky can be you know every trick to never know that there are some technical advantage besides you can print self but ultimately for a lot of site they just don't care and the people don't know who rosalyn wouldn't care and it's not that big of a deal and the browser react so aggressively now whenever you have something that's not super current or not using http at all it'll say thing like not secure kind of misleading", " when you're just going to like some blog and reading a blog post it say not secure that kind of suggested getting compromised but that's not really what's going on like so anyway how's everything are so aggressive about this now and everyone say oh it's easy just usually the reality is your now forcing every website on her out there to comply with increasingly strict requirement and mess with it increasingly frequently and ultimately like a good solution is probably something like let's encrypt which is a great idea of a let's encrypt is basically doe automated thing that you can set up that they are their own cert authority they issue only 90 day long shirt and then the idea is it's so short that it force you to automate the renewal and that's a cool idea and it's working for a lot of people it doesn't work everywhere it there's a lot of context in which that's not that can't fly or it's that's very cumbersome and not really worth it and keep in mind that when you're when the browser maker or or whoever else ratchet up the security on this stuff it just make it  harder and more cumbersome for site to continue operation or the or to start a new site or it raise the barrier so high that it further entrench ha the existing like massive hosting platform are more massive web host instead of instead of making it to the smaller player can we stay competitive and so wa all sort of issue here that like every penny ranch at the sub it it's a lot of the benefit of htps all that stuff about like not being able to be injected by your isp and the way browse retreat and everything a whole lot of that ha very little to do with the actual being used in the actual strength of that in the actual life time and privacy and sophistication of the key being used to encrypt it in the methane everything a lot of that is just because of the protocol and a different different way that work a lot of the benefit could be had with shim kit that never expire like you could just have literally non-expiring permanent certificate that would solve a lot of problem for use case where the data being transferred actually isn't all  that sensitive thing like my blog being hosted website like a lot of stuff you don't really need the encryption for encryption say can you do it for other reason or 4 less important reason people's credit card with their personal day. you know that so instead what we have is everything being ratchet it up so much that it's just causing a huge tax on on everybody who run website which these day is by the way pretty much everybody like every business ton of individual like it so it's a giant pain and i'm not sure what benefit is is worth it or necessary for the majority of site out there that's like the one of the other benefit to secure you know is i know nothing security-sensitive here is the idea that the person on the receiving end that ha greater confidence that what they're seeing in their web browser is actually what wa published by this website like the authenticity you didn't write the rent how can i be sure that the person control norco. org actually serf this content versus it just being you know corrupted or replaced or you know whatever it's all that's  part of the assurance of it you know data integrity what they are sending me is what i'm getting i wa here that itself is not pardon fast because there's all sort of men in the middle attack that there is situation where thing could be transparent leary encrypted know all sort of fact or whatever but in general having an encrypted traffic traveling in your web server and the people reading it in that flow can you know just modify the content easily and the person on the receiving end ha no idea on the first of the sending and ha no idea right that's at the start of the pain in the butt for people is real like when i first read this i kind of ground because this is this is my own fault of my whereabouts in situation grew organically from is origins a i don't want to pay a lot for this web hosting which is a good strategy when you have nothing on the web but once you have more stuff on the web and you've just been adding like little piece to that strategy it's not great so i've got many ssl certificate  many domain name many virtual host many many everything's quiet piecemeal over long period of time and in recent year i've been acquiring a cell certificate sometimes because i've had two for example switch glass that app i didn't know until i got that in france inter. app in front is an anti-fan center - are nut after high from front and center. app i didn't know the cop that domain requires ssl if you have a. after me and you literally cannot serve it over 83 browser will not go to it duration to pay it's like built into cline browsing software that certain subdomains are http only in. math is one of them so i wa forced to get ssl certificate for those thing so that's a pain and reading dealing with that because i'm bad at keeping track of these thing one of my certificate expired that i write it down how do i remove them so they are bad for security and a margo riley planned out a year is still pretty long right and you know any window of time is not great parent leave the system for revoking certificate is basically useless so if", " someone compromise yorkie there's not much you can do about it which is why i insure a lifetime's are better what is paying for people's website on the flip side of that is okay so it's a pain free website if we make it more and more painful by increment hopefully something on the other side of this will say we need a system that make it easier like like you were saying marker by like let's encrypt doing 90 day like we'll make it so short that you have to automate it because it's so painful if you don't automated and by the way we'll make it free so why are you paying for your ssl cert go let's encrypt in their free don't pay some company do it that's i see those the tension between those two thing i wanted to be easier and for year and year it hasn't gotten easier because there hasn't been a force in the other side saying we're going to make it such a pain in the butt that you better make it easier to be screwed in fact one of the party at and some of the article i read that  doesn't want the certificate lifetime to be shrunk the company that sell you ssl cert their perspective kind of like me to switch last of their ideal customer give them a big wad of money than 5 year later and give you a small amount of money every 90 day or deal with thing they don't middle point between they need to deal with a bunch of money not hear from you in five year and then tear for me every 30 day or whatever right and you know their system are designed to prevent certificate most people buy them for a lasting a long time or whatever maybe they can handle this but in general these big company that give out certificate and you know our adjusted equipped to deal with a radical shortening a certificate lifetime a people run what site are in my particular case i risk my auntie's let's encrypt cuz he want to pay i want to do it you know i'd rather you let them have to be free but roasting company doe not support let's encrypt it's one of the few company that doesn't support that most of them do they support their  own thing and i just wanted to click a bunch of button and give someone ten buck and get a certificate of nina wasn't too painful but because i did it through my husband company that did it through the third party thing they shove them into a shared house that ha 57 virtual host that all are different certificate and domain name on different registrar's all different ip address and all of the through mail route and i said confusing and it's difficult all this is to say that i really want the tooling to be easier and cheaper and ideally free for everybody and i think history is shown if there is no force on the other side making it painful that will never happen for decade like the on their own they weren't getting easier let's encrypt is the first effort to try to make them easier and that i don't know if it wa a reaction to the shortening of the last time but it took a long time to arrive so while i'm dreading the potential pain it is in store for me personally i'm hoping what we'll do is put ever more pressure on  all the different company and all the different people who make it ever easier to automate thing to follow and letting her footstep and anybody who doesn't support let's start supporting it or if you don't want to support one of the other one that charge you but make it way easier to deal with name something that people think about every two to five year if it wa something people had to think about every 30 day for like i think microsoft team remember the news in that company where i like no one wa watching certificate in their entire application brake aren't if it's expired whose job wa it to look at that and it's like i don't know we got it 5 year ago if you do a thing and it's thing is done and doesn't require any additional work very attractive for management to take the people who did that job certificate for a new product good i got a significant okay great now you're assigned to this thing to do something or maybe watching and if that can happen to microsoft with ton of money and sons of smart people you better can happen to  an individual person with a blog or something is definitely going to happen to me i put a bunch of thing in my calendar i think reminding me like two year from now cuz i did get the longest certificate so i could to renew the certificate but by the time that event come up going to be like what's the difference wa i talking about how did i get those out so yeah and then finally ha her applebee unilaterally doing this announce the judgement call like doe apple have the wait to do this on the desktop i would say no on the desktop i think today the default answer for certainly for any sort of enterprise thing is safari support on the desktop that's a nice to have but you don't have it it's not a big deal sorry mobile is obviously way more important just because they have bigger market share and figurative money share but there is a possibility that if safari doe too many thing off on the phone they become a pariah we're not going to but it doesn't work on safari to the complains about are certain or so it doesn't expire  for another year screw safari but in general the iphone but just so incredibly popular if an iphone user can't love your web page and you try to blame apple that's not going to work at the very least this is apple trying to do the right thing because it help that increase it revenue for ad tracking or like it doesn't help it sell more iphones it doesn't help it sell more max doesn't have it sell more apple tv plus subscription like this is not help apple bottom line at all really they're just doing what they think is right and they're they're basically potentially harming their own business to do it so i give him kudos for having the gut to do that i'm not entirely sure that it's going to work out a well a they say but i can't think of any particular nefarious motif for them going we are sponsored this week by linode my favorite web host go to

apple is at least considering letting user switch some default iphone apps to those of rivals so they're considering apparently letting you set maybe chrome or some other browser is default i don't even keep up with the alternative mail apps because sally to use one hand so whatever the other just because you can't change the default that's how i'd sell it. i wa just", " marking but if it since i've been out dug this hole for myself i'm going to have to try to take a deep breath and try to climb out i just personally i think fighting platform is silly i also think that trying to staple on functionality to email just wasn't designed for like snoozing and thing like that is also fairly said what is the sign for style text come through with liked whatever your you're bad cop this week i'm sorry anyway so point being that you can maybe change safari to chrome or something you can you change male to something else and potentially you might even be able to use spotify through your homepod which would be excellent and it might even be the default through siri if you recall if he wa i wa 13 is that allowed you to say you know hey dingus play the latest album from you math using spotify and then it would actually you know pipe that you to spotify and that work reasonably well so this is not being announced obviously because it wasn't even an apple that made this or that wrote the song and furthermore germann  said they're just considering it i don't see why not like this sound excellent to me i'm assuming a many others have that this is because there's been a little bit of smoke around the thought of there being potential antitrust investigation into apple for locking people into the stuff but i don't know what do you think about all this i think from a user point of view this make total sense i mean you know apple is never going to give up more control than they need to ever in anything but sometimes they get pressured to in in way that are compelling and they eventually just do it and almost always it actually work out better for everybody including them usually like it make their stuff better it make them sell more it whatever it is that you're the end there's you can book ton of example thing like obviously like the old you know running itunes on windows to let people buy ipods who weren't back on or in general ios ha obviously it started out from a very lockdown state and in many way it still is very locked on apple's app still have lot  of custom ability of third-party apps can't do overtime with almost every version of ios apple ha somehow enabled third-party apps to integrate better with the os or two to have a kimura first class experience to do thing that seriously only apple apps could do or to behave in way that only apple apps could behave and overtime they have kept knocking down those wall many many time and so from one point of view you could see this a like maybe they were going to eventually get to this anyway they just hadn't gotten to it yet and i or the or that they were there are complexity behind u they didn't want to deal with so they put it off but you know eventually becomes more compelling a other factor a you mention any trust but over time apple doe not go any limitation and they do allow third-party integrations in way that we previously wouldn't it didn't think i ever would and i never wc we are like oh my god they're there now that i have to do this thing we did so that that it's a common pattern this is noteworthy because it's been  such a long-standing request ever since app store in there ever since well ever since shortly after the app store when apple relax the rule that said you can't make apps that replicate the build it a functionality for illegal for a little while true future if you try to make a springboard clone they're going to reject that yeah yeah any kind of like this in here with the peak of you i wa expecting him to be like no just these photo go away i think it's still very rarely get in for the most part it's that rule doesn't hasn't existed for a very long time which is why we have thing we literally didn't have those thing for the first couple year for that reason anyway overtime apple ha relaxed system and allowed more third-party integration that various different endpoint and i've also pushed the ipad specifically into the mac territory in a lot of different way of how this thing can be used what user need and want from it what what degree of quote professional or or power usage can be done with it and a lot of that requires more mac like feature  to be adopted so you know thing like the file app coming over because that's what heroes youtube me up multiple window and having multiple window in the same app on the ipad stuff like that there slowly breaking up somebody's wall want it so for this the rumor is the going to allow you to set your own default mail app and browser which the mac ha offered forever like there's a preference and safaree and mail and you can set your default mail app an app so probably have to make to call elke why every single time you launch chrome for a long time after you install it hey you should set this a your default browser in there with you fighting back and forth and now apparently safari show a notification the first time you've punched chrome i'm not catalina seem like it you should try safari sound like that i don't know if this glorious you know they had this building a mac forever if you can set your default browser something else in the same way that there is a system for file extension and associating a file extension with a given app to  be a default app when you double-click file of that type there's the same thing for url scheme and their end it simply you know http or http url scheme will open the default browser whatever that said to mail to links will open the default mail app whatever that set to on the phone you have a few others you have thing like towel to make phone call yet some message thing and a few others that are special there anyway i wa to date ha not had a way to first of all if multiple apps can open the same file type or type in url scheme ios ha dealt with that very poorly so far url scheme it doesn't deal with it at all it actually just you know what kind of pic 1 is make small opening that you have no choice over it and won't let apps register for the one like htc vr mail to 2 to let them do that for file extension it ha a system that's kind of wonky and kind of work sometimes but anyway for them to add the system to ios today's italy allow web browser on ios  to register for the agency phoenix to ps game and to have some kind of ui somewhere in the system to choose which app that support those scheme is going to be your default app it's a big step to leave for so long but that seems like it's it's right in line with that gradual progression of both apple letting through party at integrated system more and more overtime and with apple pushing the ipad to be more of a a mac replacement for more people because look at what it what else coming out the reason why they they recently brought over in a little bit if they have the keyboard modifier keys panel so now you can do what i've been doing forever on on max you can change the cap lock key to escape which you could never do any i've had before now you can do that because they brought over that will preference pane that's in the modifier key section of the keyboard preference that's now and they are clearly making the ipad more and more mac like in feature-set not like minnesota vikings feature-set bring over like some some pretty good like mac", " ism that helped power user get their work on the way they want so this could just be one of those thing and combination of adding third party and progressing ipad os to be more of a neck replacement totally could make this possible on it own but the antitrust angle i think is is what is the driving force here that is making them go a little bit further or pushing them to do a thing that wa probably not high on the priority list and is probably a pain in the butt in certain way and i think now the any triangle is getting substantial because apple clearly ha a problematic monopoly over over software and purchase that happened on the iphone because it is such a massive and important computing platform in the world and so and they have already had and trust probe and investigation and and claim in various country of the eu ha been pretty good about so far the us of course we don't have functioning any trust anymore so i don't think we would ever be a problem for them in this foreseeable future but if you work the way it should  we would government warrant it would be a good see the larger problem but country that have functioning government are cat are actually already opening probe and spotify in very loud and they i believe they've been filing legal thing in the eu but anyway the initial pressure is mounting on apple from a number of angle and to me like i said i didn't impassive host of the show i think the two big escape valve that they have at that they could pull but they did i'm so they don't want to one is sideloading apps into like it to allow apps to be in sawdust out of the app store i don't think that's ever going to happen in ios ever ever ever i don't think i don't think we're going to go to app store only because i would break thing and a lot of other way but i o s i never see them enabling sideloading i just for so many reason that's never going to happen the other thing that would really live and rice pressure from them is to drop the requirement that all purchase that have done an as use their in-app  purchase system 202 basically allow somebody like amazon to build in ebook purchasing right in their kindle app or two allowed netflix to take your credit card information to write in the netflix app and find for their service without going through and i purchase without paying you 30% / 15/4 and that that would relieve almost all the interest pressure that's on them but that would also cost a lot of money and i don't think they're ever going to do that either so i think they're looking for other way that they could maybe relieve some of the antitrust pressure without doing the expensive thing whatever amount of money by enabling people like to be company to to not use in-app purchase first of all i think it's not that much money in the grand scheme of apple second of all the money is going down over time a most of those company get apple the finger and just leave anyway and just don't accept purchase at all if you can't buy that anymore a if i think march 1st you can't that you can netflix anymore i like so many of like the big top grossing in  app purchase by big come please have dropped apple's system because it just digger losing too much money on the seas so i actually think that the the amount of money apple would lose if they start allowing external purchase system is not a big a it wa a couple year ago and it and is probably not going to have a gun in the grand scheme of thing but apple is really good at making money and they're really stingy and so they're not going to give this up with that we had a major fight so instead they're probably looking for other antitrust relief valve that they are that they could swallow that they're willing to pull to reduce some of the complaining from people like spotify and another powerful entity me feel like google or chrome you know so they have a good reason to start looking for those handle the folk that are not the one that will cost them money that's probably the major driving force hear all that being said i would like him to go slightly further than what doe rumor suggests that you're suggesting basically a browser mail and music i hope  and if not if it doesn't what they have planned suggest this this should apply to anything that you can operate with a siri context where multiple apps are supported it for me one of the thing i would definitely have for is reminder for a i mentioned before the show i use the app thing great app i almost always enter thing into thing using siri on my phone and the descent that you have to use to do that a casey veggies mentioned earlier with spotify you have to say something like remind me at 10 in thing to do xyz and i would love to just not have to say in thing on every single indication and so this is like this structure already exists for a to expose their capability by intense and they have classification of okay this is a reminder of thing this is a note asking say which of those thing i can respond to system already exists for apple to make a preference pane somewhere and in the setting app that say what is your siri intent should have that ability a well not just you know music interesting here is interesting", " because you said about that especially about the purchase and access to customer like you. although it's related i still feel like it's the type of thing that apple would have eventually done on it own anyway like we've been talking about it for year and it's always just been a question of when do you want to pay that cost the complexity and it's beginning it's not appropriate you know more thing to do and now i feel like we're kind of into the natural portion of ios is lifetime on apple would be looking at this anyway so even though all that stuff is definitely a real thing and shirley influencing how they consider what they're doing to the platform i think this stuff might have just like it's time just might have come anyway maybe wa accelerate a little bit it's hard a hell if you don't know what's going on inside the company but all that said i think on this device now is not great like you are you were staying at working the way it doe i like it like under the cover over there is a url scheme or a file type or  whatever and you have a thing where you map an application to and you can choose from all the one i can handle it but that's not even how it's been mentioned it before with a lunch in chrome like how do you change your default browser in mac os well it's in safari preference and did you launch, you might get prompted and chrome will prompt you like it's basically just a shouting match between the participant to say over here i'm over here just extending that system how you know how you pick your default browser on the mac if you said to me i don't know that's not attractive there wa time in the past when it wa a lot more and more or le the way marco explain which is there wa a control panel list but like i said i believe that you're all the protocol here's what you chosen application to handle that by default hear all the other choice in a single place individual preference finder thing that let them do you know retain or surrender their default mist and i don't want them yelling at me about make me to a single  preference pane in system preference on a mac and see all the information that would be extremely helpful because there's more than just the protocol you know that you just listed is all sort of the universal link or whatever i can i wear a sweater to go to twitter.com what if i don't want to go to the twitter app what if you want to go to twitter.com is there one central place where i can control not only who control this url scheme but also for universal link whether i go to the web or do the application that's not easily under user control probably there's some technique or when you go there go there but then how long press on this enforced open uber out like there are way to do the byzantine right so i think it could be way better on the mac and i hope what they do on ios is not what they're doing because they're just repeating that problem i hope they take both of them and say imagine if all he said he's giving a single place are at least not that many setting like start small web browser mail you  know reminder podcast app like this on a screen for universal link a section for anything that claim universal i can say should i use the app or should i use the web like just something anything like this it's just just centralized them and make it more that that wa the promise to setting i don't know why the old style and the system is worse and it's also too weird to me cuz we can throw acting in this way why doe this app launch when i do this thing right why doe this go to a nap instead of a web browser how do i change my default app for this type of thing it need improvement a not a super big techno hertel i think all the plumbing is there on both system for all the stuff to work it is just a fairly straightforward you a'ight ask a thing that is apple ha done before much weaker platform with much more difficult technical hurdle surely they can make a preference to make a setting screen for some upcoming major version of both ios and macos to let u do all these thing i just want  spotify to be my fault is that so terrible terrible for her for apple homepod for spotify doesn't want chrome browser market share they've lost on the desktop to it you know apply the very beginning some much better reason to not like term of security and reliability now those reason are little le but still somewhat relevant technology on your phone making chrome your default is like now you have a different candy color wrapping around the exact same browser engine at safari is there's a lot more to a browser functionality. syncing your preference in your tab and all that's keeping track of what you do why do you think the world's biggest want to do this like this like i said before why give up that control if you don't have to i've never found remotely harley tolerable i still feel like safari on ios can probably still win on the merit in term of what it's like a user to use that application. people are different thing i run both all day long and i actually like him despite it being beast laptop le safari well and it probably wouldn't be this way but what if", " chrome on the iphone wa a huge battery hog i mean that's that's part of like that's what that's why we're getting u like if you let the apps compete on their merit people can choose not to use chromecast same way they choose not to use cross on their macs laptop cuz he's your battery if you might be like what if krome 88 your battery and it becomes what is now. now it's a lot easier to use cuz it could be set a a default browser and then instead of blaming chrome people in their iphones for having bad battery life apple pop-up of dialog that say your battery for the past 24 hour are you sure you want to give his application location service elevator honestly that one is i think the least important from my perspective anyway the mail one kill man trying to do thing the mail with a design to do but forget about all that just sometimes you don't want to use email application because you like some other one better that doe basically exactly the same thing nothing weird no weird alternate interface to email and see different thread work better  have to go back to the box weston sorry but the message that are missing the bug is like you're looking at your at your inbox of you and your new message are actually arriving in your email account but they're not showing up in the list they actually are showing up they show up the very bottom of the list a list that should be sure on screen but if you don't scroll all the way down to the bottom of your inbox with most people don't but they're in the wrong place make me think that this is a really in a possibly tricky bug maybe with like combined or whatever the dui difficult to sort of thing to not make the screen reshuffle when you're staring at it i don't know but a whole bunch of stuff about data source and have stuff to amethi automatically based on response in the data model and everything i'm guessing there's a bug it somewhere in that day or the way it's being used here that is that's why every single iowa probably but buddy i like that this thing about mail application is like if you don't mostly stay  with your email account if it's going to receive that email and especially an ios depending on their control over how much i don't ever want to but i am forced to have it both installed and configured with a working email address on my phone going to want to mail and if i don't have any mail which mean i have to be receiving a lot of email and have a limited we really want to do something other than mail on my phone just so i don't have to have the email application must also be configured to receive mail from one of my actual account send it so much i would just not the case in browser like i have a second browser and i wa going to use my browser doesn't constantly downloading something like you don't need to configure a new install another valid reason i think i shouldn't say valitutto on the arbiter of such thing but whatever another reason i can think of that you would want different mail app is if you have some sort of like corporate situation where you have to use some blessed corporate app that only we know", " it wa something like outlook will the outlook is reasonably sane or complain if i remember right but anyways you have something where it it stack niko's proprietary mail app and that's what you want to use on say your work phone then that would make perfect sense to me that's one of a million different reason why one would genuinely want to do a separate mail app even if they don't do like you said the snoozing and all the weird stuff that stapled on the side of a female these face pessimistic take on this whole default app thing is like it's the flip side of the reasoning having such control in the beginning but the whole the product image like how doe the iphone how is it received by customer what is it that they see it's entirely different apple still very sensitive to the idea that if you get it i want to make sure that you have no experience with is good is good fanciest like the whole point is there supposed to be simple and apple quality but good quality application just want to start using unbox an hour wandering through the app. store  the giant forest application trying to find the one that is free or cheap that is well-reviewed like i don't want to go shopping at me i want to get the phone down so i can already browse the web i can already send email i can already read the news i can only listen to podcast you know like come bundled with that stuff in that it's important that supposed to be and to be good and a lot of the complaint that we had on the shown at apple's first party application walnut terrible are no longer like the shining example of saying this is how insert whatever application should be made location ha never been but i don't think people look at it and say boy you really want to see how to make an email client look at apple mail i haven't heard that in a long time you spent it on the desktop or any kind of like apple is clearly the the leader simple-to-use like i just want a basic many category third-party application are clearly better and always been stuff because they're more complicated than just simple application are there many category were  apple not the leader one way i could deal with that is double down and make them better like i did with note for a long time note wa just not a good the new note is way better also not be more complicated make sure all your apps keep up make sure every apps ha a note like maybe fall behind a little bit maybe it just make it just make it better right but that doesn't seem to be happening that quickly and maybe you know that's the system of the developer they brag about all the time is it those people can make a really good reminders app like thing and then it's not on apple to also have a team internally that also make the best reminder app in the world is a million you have to do listen to all the thing apple should be investing in making a web browser reminder when you get the phone you will have good apps and all these category but also there are even better one on the app store that you can go to know by and it's really easy for you to say i need to  use that one instead that make people like their phone better not worse so they get the benefit of not having to go shopping you know the getting something with battery included that doe all the stuff but if they're interested in one particular thing like i'm not really into these thing but i'm really into you know reminder they can just go and swap out that go like take advantage of their ecosystem and don't like their phone better so that's the world that i would like to see and i feel like apple should have the courage to do that both because they should have some confidence that on a level playing field are good apps like safari pretty well and also because they should be afraid of someone getting money and reminder it ha to be there ha to be good but if someone replaces it with thing they love their phone more that's good for apple to be stopped by another phone so i really hope this rumor is true and i really hope they do it and do it in a better way than the max kellerman. respond to this week by indeed

thank you so much too windy for sponsoring our show felicity smith katie katie and steven gerstacker right now that the three of you have apps on the  app store be curious to hear how each of you handle the quote-unquote business side of the app store i'm in a similar situation of john write a handful that's what i ultimately work for myself and i've made a very minimal amount money from it the app store set up to me daunting so i'd love to know how you guy do it yourselves up from humpies development full-blown self employment development i understand the word that that are written here but i'm not clear what steven is looking for so john since he seems most interested in you what did you do in front and center of that there is a surprising amount of like form that you have to click around through and thing that you have to fill out but didn't general you know i think just you don't need that much handle thing you go to the website you can give you money and if you're not making any real money like i am like i'm let you know a lot on application for yourself or whatever that's fine a an individual to do you can just come up the street a an adult human", " at least another country's upload it click around through many many many screen enter information for that's what i'm doing because i'm not the most symbol but i need to save it if you just have a bunch of elapsed you wrote yourself or are going to write yourself and you just want to sell them on the store you can do that and you don't need any anyting else you don't need a lawyer you don't need to create a company you don't need to have employee are the country i'm hoping it's not going to be too intimidating i guess i'll find out but i think the barrier is actually pretty low and i think if you are just a hobbyist doing it for fun in a little extra money with no real need to go farther than that so i'm not i'm still not entirely clear what state wa after before it's worth for fast text may it rest in peace a to do in the sun for a pic of you and then yet i am using y'all see that i had set up for basically all of my then extracurriculars and now my my life  and that wa mostly unremarkable cuz i'd set up a llc previously you do need to get a dun number a dun bradstreet number which i forget exactly what that involved but i don't remember being terribly bad and i remember them really really wanting me to pay them a whole pile of money to do something in marco and underscore saying for the love of god don't do it so that wa good this is dunn's to be clear that wa done is not apple but perhaps when we get to your second you can explain done something with your what the purpose it serf a but nevertheless bi i am under my llc get paid by apple apple's relationship is with the llc and i'm not a lawyer that's not legal advice but my a very limited ate mostly ignorant understanding is that if something went wrong somewhere somehow my elephant to be sued and all of the llc's money could be i'll go up in smoke but hypothetically from legal legal perspective me the person in my family would be protected and so that's part of his why did it again not legal advice don't trust me  on this look it up for yourself this is obviously very very very different depending on where you live but that's the way i have set mine up and i think i don't think it's that dissimilar from you marco although maybe if you wanted to at least comment about when you choose to set up a new llc and a new set up with apple because my understanding wa a while ago it wa very very difficult to sell a nap and you had to basically sell any tire company in in order to make it easier on the apple side can you perhaps talk a little bit about that in addition to whatever else you'd like that they didn't have before transfer that you can do and at least it wouldn't work if you ever use certain title men's including icloud i don't know if that's still true haviland do a recently a bit might still be but yeah in general it's a lot easier to sell an entire developer account to accompany then to try to break an app out of your account and and then give them it used to be in probably still is possible", " to upload apps to the app store using your personal apple id because of what i just said it but i wa very hard to ever transfer an app out of it out of a developer account i don't recommend doing this because i be thinking you never expect to make it to get money from it and you never use case would never have anybody want to buy it like that want to buy the app from you then fine otherwise save the business one is probably the right move i to use llc's i do pretty much everything under llc's that's at all professional for the reason case you mention of legal protection and everything asked if he also mentioned we are not lawyer and these thing very thing and where you are so speak to a lawyer if you're concerned about liability protection but that's a lot of these lucrative apps onto my personal apple id what if i want to sell friend center now it's tied in the same account it's not actually my first met my date is a separate both of them are in the same apple id what's the difference in what's the  different consideration when shopping for a tv for console a monitor for a console or monitor for gaming pc i have no input on this and i'm guessing that marco may not either so listen to jason john what do you do here but it wasn't that complicated peterson on console connect to tvs not computer and computer monitor have a couple thing to worry about different kind of flat panel are different kind of but i'll get it now it is much more complicated than used to be partly because every tv can also more or le ss a a computer monitor every console can connect to your television or computer monitor like the convergence of monitor and tv saying like to the point where it's really pushing television set but there are concern that are different in each domain and software-related if you're looking for something that you're going to play a game on there are some feature that you're interested in that you don't care about if you just going to watch tv on and on those are the ancillary thing related to where they called adaptive frame rate or i should have these thing down there's  thing that let you change the phrase there's some proprietary thing depending on what you're going to be connecting to it like i could do similar thing there's auto low latency mode on television switch try to detect that you have a console connected and go into a moto you have the lowest amount of input year ago tv manufacturer didn't even know what input lag wasn't even listed in their spec nobody cared about except for video gamers new test themselves using these light rig they're building in game mode if you are gaming care about those thing look at the input lag look for auto i would look for variable refresh rate that's a nothing thank you chat room that what i wa going to pick up gerber refresh rate is the actual refresh rate right so television used to only have to refresh it like some reasonable multiple of the frame rate of television refresh rate if no point in having a hundred frame per second is updating 60 time a second doe just waste it right so gaming monitor and now television the support location have higher refresh rate so don't get a television reddit 60  hearts expecting to play under and 20 frame per second it's pointless you're not going to get any benefit so if you're going to game outlook for all those thing i refresh rate variable refresh rate auto latency mode and then also picture quality price size keith and noise the whole nine yard it's more complicated but there are a bunch of thing they're only going to watch tv on it for frame per second do you have to wear that too much and variable refresh rate is not really an important thing for video because most video content the single refresh rate through the whole thing and it certainly isn't changing from moment to moment although that's not entirely true there are some thing right there he's so there you go finally future been right i've been tearing my hair out over this question for year when to use a notes app like apple note versus traditional file for casual user they may not be an issue but the further down the rabbit hole you go the more the paradigm compete with one another from me if i am writing something down or copying url or something along those  line that go to the apple note and if it's like a pdf or something like that it go in the file system and that's about it marco how do you handle this i don't have sonic dash pad and i do actually use it for like some long-term storage or something but i'm not very consistent about it i've used it more of a time this wasn't part of the question but i do wish that note had a filesystem representation that wa meaningful and that could be backed up an important exported that is that is one thing like a i use note for more and more stuff i am a little bit afraid of somebody losing all my note because of some icloud mishap or some local whatever and i don't know how to back it up i don't know how to restore it and i think there are as reason like export your note out in various format but i don't know of any kind of import after that so i don't i don't know that it make me look up note doesn't restore your note in easily parsed file system representation make me a little  bit uneasy the decision point about this is do you want to use and trust an app that is a collection of data mediates the data store because once you do that bug in that change in business model of anything having to do with that app can get between you and your information do it a individual especially if those are playing text file it's more annoying but you also don't have to worry about you know the app that control them even just changing a pax change their user interface now i hate it good apps for matt and maybe an import ability to go the other direction but i wa talking about exactly that thing with note i'm putting increasing my stuff in note to and i wa getting paranoid about backup maryland recommended this note exporter app there's a couple of cop out to the december thing where they will give me to go through all your note and export each one a like a pdf or something which is not great but it's better than nothing so i ran that serve automation and apparently at a certain point note just surrender then stop exporting thing  and don't know if it's a bug the automation or something like that. it's been a challenge to do with short cut but note is an example of an application that i think it's pretty solid and i haven't had any problem with it but it doe not have really good export and import functionality built into the app a far a i'm aware which is why we're trying to use a third-party app so i kind of organic to watch for if you decide i'm going to use a nap and not a bunch of individual file cuz individual file are pain in my butt and it's so much easier to just pick up my phone and use it note that's an easy decision to make in the moment and then fast forward 6 month and now you have substantial amount of valuable they didn't know it happens to the best of u too bad i feel like is the distinction it's trusting a sort of having to do all that stuff yourself it's like note to me it's like nuclear power and a long a it's wrong there's a lot of thing like about it you just hope  nothing ever go wrong cuz if something go wrong is going to go really wrong doe it produce and way that we haven't figured out yet we're just going to put that question after another time sponsor this week in deed and proclip usa now this show is over they didn't even mean to begin a it wa accidental poet wa accidental margo and casey wouldn't let me because it wa accidental what wa accidental. fm and if you can find them at a s i l l s m a r t r a c i really really did not want to downgrade this machine so mojave that this restaurant wa going to get in mojave tomorrow so all of a sudden came back and i'm like okay and then all the sudden you guy disappeared hijack is still counting skype is still counting everything's fine and then i heard skype set out your microphone is screwed again so marco you. have a fun at it i'm sorry but i i am i am putting it on record that if i am still on catalina this time next week please have some way somehow send somebody kick me square", " in the gentleman region because this this is intolerable and i can't stand it and this is all we got we got so many so much flack last week after i went on a tear about catalina and yo ha something to say oh okay here's why i think i deleted some usable because i am trying to do my job and i cannot because thing failed while i wa trying to do my job is that a satisfactory enough reason for you to everyone so this is getting mohave tomorrow and i am so cranky right now and you're going to be cranky when you deal with my 400 file tomorrow so and that make me cranky cuz i don't like making other people cranky and you're going to get a first time you go to use with you i got away with it can you refer to your computer room at least if not i hear you i hear you in and if i were in your shoe i would say the same thing but all i know is this machine wa bulletproof on mojave and since i put catalina on cuz my darn fool everything is gone  worse everything everything everything ha gotten worse i also have not modified right before i do the upgrade to the upgrade or do i just throw everything we're like hotel in your own house like you have no every night so i'm going to come and erase your whole computer and you wouldn't notice but you don't actually get habanero i don't use dropbox anymore but lionel dropbox and thing like that but the good news from having to do this 84 time over the last few month that have come very very good at operation my my dad when he wa just born he had a plymouth duster if i remember if i remember correctly and i forget what the issue ended up being like something wa missed the line but they didn't know what the longest time i might have told the story a well but the house that that we had lived in when i wa freshly born my dad had the house built and in the garage is there a pit so you know you would draw you drive the car onto lake boards of plank or i don't know like maybe with metal for all  i know we were driving on these piece of metal let's say and then you could climb down under the car so it's like an email the inverse of a lift and what it happened is he wa keep going through clutch in this may in this duster in my understanding of family legend tell me that they that mom and dad could do an entire clutch in this car in like the span of two or three hour or something else something else we were fostering because they were doing it like once every two month or something like that figured out the problem and fix it properly but yeah that's me with this with this darn computer and so are all kidding aside i have what i thought to be a bulletproof super duper backup of mojave sitting on a hard drive on my desk starting with marco and then john would you trust in use that in to plow with currently on the machine or would you just go for broken and install fresh i would baby first boot it and see how it is and then maybe decide after that weird stuff would happen if you", " don't have any of your file i think that that's a recipe for accidental data loss of stuff you've made in the meantime i threw my list of place where i do store stop you don't like there are a handful of thing on my desktop by there may be some thing and downloaded that i care about you and setter setter i know backup my plex database and so on and so forth all that stuff will happen before i even worry about in a booting off of the super duper back up but assuming that's super duper backup boot reasonably well and do you think you would use it but you don't like it i'll put the ticket and put it onto the machine and how old is that at this point my 3 week a month different. i don't know if i if i had down if i actually start at weird hour but you're you're into the hotel and lifestyle anyway you should just wipe his machine and put a fresh like the savior. if you think you actually know how to say birthday to do that i would suggest making a full clone and setting  that aside to let me know if you just remembered oh by the way i wa also go to the the actual partition of a nabi apfs container level with the actual gpt partition partition level and then get rid of all the stuff that i think you probably convinced me first of all that i'll do it i'll do a super duper this one just for safety's sake and then i'll i'll go into internet recovery delete everything on this hard drive to your point and then start fresh with mojave super duper also get caught up on time machine week i will no longer be on catalina cuz this is driving me absolutely batty and i do love dark mode i really do in the dark me when it's evening that is i do love dark mode and i do love having this sweet sweet with you i preview but it it's not worth it is not worth it not for me wonder like what's your long-term game plan here i honestly don't know i hope you have got or or perhaps wait another few point lisas and see what happens you know like it when we have", " what is the right now it's used to gauge whether it's safe to upload to 10155 10156 cuz i don't know i don't go backwards i only got whatever going back is a a big deal it's hard and potentially destructive to certain thing and then be you're going to have to go forward again at some point anyway it would what do i do in the meantime though you know like this is unacceptable for me and for you yes oh it's so i think i think the other answer is like there's lot of u who are doing podcast on catalina have a problem so catalina is probably not the problem there may be so maybe something is being worse than catalina maybe it's a coincidence of timing who know but like i'm podcasting on catalina using the same usb device that you use that you're using for i did last week and it wa obviously like it is possible to use catalina without having problem you're having right now so the os version itself is probably not the problem it may have exacerbated thing may have brought thing to the foreground or make me go into it  so i wouldn't i wouldn't start investigating other potential explanation and end so letting what though so thing like changing out the trackpad for attract had to like it's just like you but you have to try the other one do you use in wired mode i actually am tonight that's the first time which is okay so to that end do something well maybe maybe you're right or mirror the very least unplug it when a podcast that's actually very interesting point in the first place wa because of all the issue i wa having yeah with like really bad latency in the machine gun trackpad and all that so it seems like my choice are you use it on bluetooth where i've got machine-gunned trackpad and really bad pointer latency use it when it's plugged in and potentially have some sort of issue with my microphone so i guess the answer is i unplug when i record and plug in when i'm not recording like this shouldn't be a problem to have dinner like dude that's usual dance to do is like start removing disconnecting everything from your computer until this feeling in pewter by itself with nothing  connected to anything else i have a cord connected to my computer that's that i could plug into an external hard drive but it's not presently plugged into an external hard drive cable trying to figure out what the hell is the problem with a thing like that staticky thing like maybe it wa the simulator simulator what about other thing to try like making sure that the audio interface and the trackpad are not share usb bus i don't know how you can do that a certain port are different bus maybe you can put the trackpad on a hub and not put the audio interface not like her face directly to 1/4 in the back and then put track that interface on something or like use one of the usb a port for the trackpad and use the usb c port using a c to b cable like there is there are there something like that that's what i do i do the way to just try to separate this device that you think is possibly cause any problem from thing that are critical to work for your job like i'm so you haven't had it be two  separate part of the computer like at 8 you can probably look up somewhere like me i bet i bet certain pair or set are uncertain usb bus that probably isn't all one bus a far a i can a 2 or 3 controller in there so i would try that because like you would like usb this is a weird protocol with weird device a flake out sometimes and like one bad usb device can wreak havoc on a system so the more you can do like try to isolate it or try to swap out the trackpad for a different one and see if that work trying that first is easier and probably more more likely to work bench eating your entire life version yeah i just i feel like i want the nuclear option but that you're convinced the two of you were convincing me that maybe i'm getting a little depressed could be like some bad behavior unless you did actually letting you know what it wa like some chatter usb thing or the fact that you refused to go into your own attic and get the track that outfit would you with the two of", " you rather me try a different track that or go back to a mouse cuz i'm pretty sure i don't have an issue with him out so i used up until literally like 6 month ago david and i would never want it so i would figure out what the hell is wrong with what option do i have that i wa going to figure out what the hell's waking it up by process of elimination and disconnecting everything running a system is saying what if i have this program but you know eventually got it mostly under control cuz that wa my only option that's always my first choice is to actually debugging which is annoying and laborious but usually can be done or at least lead you to a conclusion it's like i found the problem and i have no fixed word there for a while i'll be down greatest the only option right but at least you'll know something about it then yeah so i'm sorry where do we land so would you rather me get a different trailing it again go to the attic to and get a different track pad or just issue track ha  entirely in just go to a regular magic magic mountain either one of the equation of the thing to do weird crap doe still do weird crap of the mouse doe it still do we're grab with my other trackpad like whatever just start you know i'm running experiment until you can figure out when doe when doe bluetooth mode and see if you have and then possibly try to usb in different pork kind of situation but i'd say first try a bluetooth i heard wa complaining about various like in a bluetooth disconnect that i've been having for year on my max with the mouse and the trackpad a few people told me over the year that this can happen with 2.4 gigahertz interference try to minimize a much a possible had a pretty good effect for them and so this could be thing like switching a much a your wife i said wa possible over to 5.8. that would be in or near your office where your computer is you could try that a well although i actually i hate i hate to jinx anything here maybe i should knock on if i could find some actual  wood around here i have not had the bluetooth mouse and trackpad random disconnection bug and a little while i don't know exactly when the last time that happened wa but it hasn't been recently been probably at least a month or two so i think they might have fixed that finally after like 3 year of it being a constant problem so i think that that my bug is fixed try to reduce 2.4 gigahertz radio traffic in the area and try and switch over to bluetooth so it's try testing machine gun trackpad thing to see if it still is still applies to the new trackpad that you should have been switching to a long time ago i will try to trackpad first the problem is i don't have any real like i have a bunch of annotate i would like i said earlier on thing that seem to make it worse but i don't have anything where i can say do this than this and this and this and bam it happened so you know just so frustrating play boy problem of the same thing i had to wait for hour you put it to sleep and  then you'd have to come back in the morning and see when it woke up and how frequently and why and it's at the top of the top of the bug cycle but i mean if it actually is a problem you should be able to make it happen just by using your computer right did you have to hook up your podcast microphone and just be recording all day long with your headphone on the bug news program ha no fun and your computer setup is also no fun. they are very similar at least at least you're sitting there in front of your computer i spent today to switch which is worse email it to be clear not through screen sharing would have been so much easier when you're just like i need to text on your machine is depth build back and forth with print statement that's great found the bug though good"]
